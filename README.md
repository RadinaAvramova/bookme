# Let's Build an event scheduling app with Ruby on Rails 7

An application inspired by Calendly, an excellent tool for scheduling events or meetings with pre-established availability. Calendly seems simple on the surface, but once you start working with anything related to dates and time in programming, it starts to get complex fast..

## Goals for the app

The general idea is to mimic the primitive features of Calendly. An end user can visit a unique direct link to book events with someone else. These events can be free to book or require payment. Those that book events shouldn't be necessary to create an account. Those that make the events and availability slots **do** need an account.
